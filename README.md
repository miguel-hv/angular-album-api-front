# DevChallengeApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.10 as part of a dev challenge (June 2021) within 7 days. With minimalist style based on the brand logo and using bootstrap grid it was created a CRUD app for consuming a given API (which I eventually [cloned in Node](https://github.com/miguel-hv/node-album-api)). 

Both apps were deployed in Heroku and can be visited [here](https://albums-api-dev-challenge.herokuapp.com).
